🛒 Amazon Clone (HTML & CSS Only)
Welcome to my Amazon Clone – a simple and static replica of the Amazon homepage built using only HTML and CSS. This is the first web clone I've ever built, and it helped me understand the structure of real-world websites and how layout, design, and responsiveness come together.

🔨 What I Used
HTML5 – for structuring the page.

CSS3 – for styling and layout.

⚠️ No JavaScript used – This is a static, non-functional UI clone focused only on visual representation.
